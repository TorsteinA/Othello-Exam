#Othello

This game was made by *Torstein Alvern* in December 2016 as an exam in the language "C programming for Linux"
It does not have a git history before June 2017 as it was created locally, and never uploaded during development.

An inproved AI based on a greedy algorithm was since added to it, but the code has been lost. The current AI is brute-force-random
